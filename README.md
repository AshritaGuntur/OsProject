# OsProject
Security has become an integral aspect of modern computing systems. From basic login portals to high-level enterprise applications, user authentication plays a pivotal role in safeguarding data and controlling access. The project titled “Basic Security System in C” is a simplified simulation of user registration and login mechanism, implemented using the C programming language.

This system allows a user to register with a custom username and password. Once registered, the system prompts the user to log in using the credentials. If the user enters incorrect credentials consecutively, the system triggers a lockout period during which login attempts are temporarily disabled. After the lock duration, the user can attempt to log in again. This functionality mimics real-world systems such as ATM login delays, account lockouts, or administrative login systems that prioritize both security and usability.

This project introduces core programming concepts such as string manipulation, conditional checks, loops, use of time-based functions for delays, and global variable management. By incorporating basic cybersecurity principles into a beginner-friendly project, this implementation not only enhances coding skills but also cultivates awareness about system protection and safe authentication practices.

The abstract provides an overview of the project's scope, motivation, and objectives. It reflects how a simple, command-line interface can represent fundamental security workflows while giving a strong foundation for future enhancements such as encryption, database connectivity, or biometric integration.
